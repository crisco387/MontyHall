## About
##### A cumulative project for Berkeley's [WebDev Decal](https://www.cubstart.com/)
Featuring the Monty Hall Problem, this interactive site aims to provide some intuition behind what appears to be a paradox. Users can both manually participate in and simulate the monty hall problem, recording their winning percentage based on their strategy of switching doors or sticking with their initial door.
